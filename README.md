# Firebase Realtime Database Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Firebase's `update()` method with deeply nested data in the Realtime Database.  The client-side code appears to successfully update the data, but the changes are not reflected in the database. The solution involves restructuring the update operation to handle nested updates correctly.  See `bug.js` for the problematic code and `bugSolution.js` for the corrected version.

**Bug:** Incorrectly structured update operation, leading to no database changes despite client-side success.

**Solution:**  Correctly structuring update operation using dot notation for nested fields to ensure updates are applied to the intended locations in the database.
